# factory Patter

- is a creations design pattern that provides a way to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to client. It encapsulates the object creation process, making the code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.

- Tha factory pattern is useful when we have to create multiple objects that share the same properties, without having to repeat the same code over and over.
- A factoty function can easily return a custom object depending on the current environment, or user-specific configuration.

## Benefits:

1. Encapsulation: The object creation logic is hidden within the factory, making the code more modular and easier to understand.
2. Flexibility: New product types can be added without modifying the existing code.
3. Reusability: code can be reused in different parts of the application.
